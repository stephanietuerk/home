    I design and build systems, primarily in code, that turn complex data into
    useful and intelligible tools. I love working at the intersection of
    structure, meaning, and interaction, and translating between quantitative
    data, language, and visual representation. This work draws on my training as
    an architect, historian, and engineer.

        Currently, I lead design and frontend development on high-complexity,
        data-heavy public-sector applications at Mathematica, a quantitative
        public policy research firm. I joined in 2019 as the company’s first
        design-focused hire on the web team. Since then I’ve grown and led the
        design practice, served as the frontend lead for our most demanding
        web-based deliverables, and mentored both designers and engineers.

        Before moving into data visualization and interface work in 2017, I
        spent many years in the field of architecture (M.Arch and PhD in the
        History, Theory, and Criticism of Architecture and Art). My current work
        designing interfaces, systems, and developer tools builds on that
        background in both method and focus. I approach system and interface
        design as a continuation of longstanding lines of inquiry: how to
        construct meaning from complexity, how to organize evidence for an
        audience, and how to make that meaning legible through the development
        of consistent and coherent systems of design.
