  <p class="about-text">
    I am a curious individual broadly interested in how knowledge is produced. I
    am trained as an engineer, designer, and historian, and now design and
    develop interactive data visualizations and data-driven web applications at <a class="about-text about-link" href="https://www.mathematica.org/about-mathematica" target="_blank">Mathematica Policy Research</a>. Before I became involved with web-based
    information design and production, I spent a number of years in
    architecture, first as a designer and then as a historian and educator. I am
    thrilled that my current work allows me to synthesize my analytic and
    creative abilities while engaging with both a long-standing interest in the role of
    quantification in society and contemporary modes of
    knowledge production.

    I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts and use she/her pronouns. My last name is
    pronounced "turk". My favorite free-time activites include rock climbing,
    running, rehabing my sports-related injury of the month, recreating dishes I
    ate when I lived in Singapore, attempting to finish a full week's worth of
    NYT Crosswords, and watching international films.
