<p class="about-text">
  I am a curious individual broadly interested in how knowledge is produced. I am trained as an engineer, designer, and historian, and now design and develop interactive data visualizations and
  data-driven web applications at Mathematica Policy Research. Before I became involved with web-based information design and production, I spent a number of years 
  in architecture, first as a designer and then as a historian and educator. I am thrilled to have found a field that allows me to synthesize this experience with my interests and affinities while engaging with contemporary modes of knowledge production.
