    I design and build systems, primarily in code, that turn complex data into
    useful and intelligible tools. I love working at the intersection of
    structure, meaning, and interaction, and translating between quantitative
    data, visual representation, and language. This work draws on my training as
    an architect, historian, and engineer.

        Currently, I lead design and frontend development on high-complexity,
        data-heavy public-sector applications at Mathematica, a quantitative
        public policy research firm. I joined in 2019 as the company’s first
        design-focused hire on the web team, and since then I’ve grown and led
        the design practice, served as the frontend lead for our most demanding
        web-based deliverables, and mentored both designers and engineers.

        Before moving into data visualization and interfaces in 2017, I spent
        many years in the field of architecture (M.Arch and PhD in the History,
        Theory, and Criticism of Architecture and Art), and my current work is
        deeply informed by that background. I believe that complex information
        is best made legible to users—whether end-users of an application or
        developers using tools or reading code—through consistent and systematic
        application of design logic. I approach interface and system design as
        part of a continued practice of assembling evidence, framing
        interpretation, and constructing meaning in and for the public.
