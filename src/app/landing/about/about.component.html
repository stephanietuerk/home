    <p class="about-text">
        Currently, I am a data visualization/front-end engineer and designer at Mathematica (formerly known as
        Mathematica Policy Research, no relation to Wolfram), where I work primarily on web applications that create
        interactive, explorable interfaces for public health/health policy-related data.

    <p class="about-text">
        Before entering the world of data visualization in mid-2017, I spent many years in the field of architecture
        (M.Arch and PhD in History, Theory, and Critcism of Architecture), and before that, majored in both Civil
        Engineering and Urban Studies as an undergrad. Although data visualization may seem like a departure from that
        path, in my mind it is much more a synthesis of it. Data visualization, to me, involves drawing together
        evidence to make an argument in the same way that a historian makes an argument from primary sources, and it
        allows me to combine my design and analytic sensibilities in a single endeavor. It also allows me to be adjacent
        to practices that seek to build quantitative understandings of the world, a subject that I have enjoyed thinking
        critically about since taking two very influential courses on the history of measurement, statistics, and
        probability in society as a PhD student.

        I also really enjoy the coding aspects of making data-driven web applications/data visualizations, including the
        never-ending learning process. Right now I'm interested in ways to build design efficiencies for small teams in
        which a full-on design system would be overkill. This will likely change, at least slightly, in three months as
        some new challenge comes my way.

        In my spare time, I do a fair number of sporty things (running, rock climbing, cycling), try to watch a lot of
        decently high-quality films (mostly contemporary and non-American), and lament the lack of amazing street food
        in Cambridge/Somerville, MA, where I live. My last name is pronounced "Turk".
