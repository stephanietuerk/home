    I design and develop applications that transform data into information. This work is informed by my education and
    experience as an architect, engineer, and historian.

    <p class="about-text">
        Currently, I am a data visualization/front-end engineer and designer at Mathematica (formerly known as
        Mathematica Policy Research, no relation to Wolfram), where I work primarily on web applications that create
        interactive, explorable interfaces for public health/health policy-related data.

    <p class="about-text">
        Before entering the world of data visualization in mid-2017, I spent many years in the field of architecture
        (M.Arch and PhD in History, Theory, and Critcism of Architecture), and before that, majored in both Civil
        Engineering and Urban Studies as an undergrad. Although data visualization may seem like a departure from that
        path, in my mind it is much more a synthesis of it. Data visualization, to me, involves drawing together
        evidence to make an argument in the same way that a historian makes an argument from primary sources, and it
        allows me to combine my design and analytic sensibilities in a single endeavor that is fundamentally concerned
        with making information public. I also enjoy that it places me in close proximity to practices that seek to
        build quantitative understandings of the world, a subject that I have very much enjoyed thinking critically
        about since taking two very influential courses on the history of measurement, statistics, and probability in
        society as a PhD student.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
        I also really enjoy the coding aspects of making data-driven web applications/data visualizations, including the
        never-ending learning process. Right now I'm interested in ways to build design efficiencies for small teams in
        which a full-on design system would be overkill. This will likely change, at least slightly, in three months as
        some new challenge comes my way.
    </p>
    <p class="about-text">
        In my spare time, I enjoy running, rock climbing, sometimes cycling, international travel, recreating foods I
        once ate somewhere and generally trying new things in the kitchen, and watching a bunch of films either on Mubi
        or at the amazing local theaters near me in the Cambridge, MA area. My last name is pronounced "Turk".
