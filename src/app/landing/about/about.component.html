    I am a product engineer who discovers what users need from complex,
    technical systems and builds interfaces that prioritize intelligibility,
    utility, and delight. I love translating between quantitative data,
    language, and visual representation, and developing systematic approaches to
    both engineering and design challenges. This work draws on my training as an
    architect, historian, and engineer.

        Currently, I lead design and frontend development on high-complexity,
        data-heavy public-sector applications at Mathematica, a quantitative
        public policy research firm. I joined in 2019 as the company’s first
        design-focused hire on the web team. Since then I’ve grown and led the
        design practice, served as the frontend lead for our most demanding
        web-based deliverables, mentored both designers and engineers, and led
        our frontend delivery practice.

        Before moving into data visualization and interface work in 2017, I
        spent many years in the field of architecture (M.Arch and PhD in the
        History, Theory, and Criticism of Architecture and Art). My current work
        designing interfaces, systems, and developer tools builds on that
        background, facilitating continued inquiry into how to organize evidence
        for an audience, how to construct meaning from complexity, and how to
        make that meaning legible through the development of consistent and
        coherent systems of design.
