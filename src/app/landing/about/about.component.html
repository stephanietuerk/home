<p class="about-text">
  I am a curious individual broadly interested in how knowledge is produced. I am trained as an engineer, designer, and historian, and now design and develop interactive data visualizations and
  data-driven web applications at Mathematica Policy Research. Before I became involved with web-based information design and production, I spent a number of years 
  in architecture, first as a designer and then as a historian and educator. I am thrilled that my current work allows me to synthesize my creative and analytic abilities 
  with a long-standing interest in the role of quantification in society while engaging with contemporary modes of knowledge production.
