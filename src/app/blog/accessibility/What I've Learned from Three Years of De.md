What I've Learned from Three Years of Designing and Developing 508 Compliant Web Applications (Often Centered Around Data Visualizations)

1. The reason websites don't have better accessibility is because that has not been understood as a priority.

2. Making accessibility a priority needs to be a decision that comes from much higher than any web development team itself.

In making any website, decisions are made about what to prioritize and spend time and money on. Some organizations will spend money on design and some won't. Some will take the time to write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code and for some, spaghetti code is good enough. So long as it takes extra time to do something, someone has to allocate time/money for it.

If you are asking the question "how do we make data viz accessible" you are asking the wrong question. Data visualization is indeed a distinct way of formatting and representing information, but it is not a useful way, in my opinion, to think about accessibility. Why not? Because the tools and techniques required to make something accessible specific to media (web, print, etc), NOT the content.
