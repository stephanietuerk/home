I learned a tremendous amount during that process and feel like it's a waste to keep it to myself. I've had a number of conversations with current academics (mostly Ph.D students or recent grads) about leaving and wanted to jot down some of the things I find myself saying many times, with the hope that it will be useful to others.",

My experience is that almost everyone, including people who go on to have very successful academic careers, has had this thought. But it seems like a lot of discomfort around it remains and as a result, it is a thought that people often seem to have alone. I hope that my experiences can provide context for people's own thoughts on this subject and can also help to normalize them.",

            "I first started imagining alternate careers when I was abroad doing dissertation research, completely unstimulated by and lost with my research. Mostly these were fantasies of jobs that were very different than academia and that likely wouldn't have been something I wanted to pursue long-term.",
            "Those fantasies somewhat abated, but several years later, stuck and frustrated in the writing phase of my dissertation (and now abroad on a different continent), I had an important revelation: I realized and admitted to myself how miserable I was. This thought hadn't come to my mind before because all I could think about was my dissertation progress. If someone had asked me if I was happy I would have likely said, 'well, I'm behind in my dissertation writing and who knows how I'll get funding for next year and then what about the job market after I finish so, I don't know, I guess it's kind of hard to be happy under those circumstances.' In other words, I hadn't been thinking of my happiness as either something valuable or something that I had control over before this.",
            'Realizing how unhappy I was, I tried to assess how and when that would change if I stayed in academia. I tried to imagine the best outcome possible for me in the field. Actually, I tried to imagine one that was far better than what was actually possible, and I saw myself ten years later, still miserable and feeling like a fraud, even as a tenured professor at some very fancy school.',
            "I realized -- or rather, finally admitted to myself -- that I just had no investment in my field anymore. The most engaging courses I took as a PhD student were all outside of my field, and I couldn't figure out how to translate them into scholarship in my field. I didn't want to buy books in my field anymore and I felt like I had nothing truly meaningful to say within it.",
            "Additionally, since this was the mid to late 2010s, the job market was just getting worse and worse. I knew that my chances of getting a job were not great -- especially since I had nothing to say! (ha) -- and I knew that if I was already miserable as a Ph.D student / postdoc, things would only get worse -- and probably way worse -- if I was barely scraping by financially and moving every semester for VAP jobs. That life is challenging for anyone, but if you actually aren't even excited by your field and doing work within it (with the exception of teaching which I have always loved but we all know that your career is made on scholarship) -- I just found myself saying, why would I subject myself to that? I could not think of a single reason.",
            "I will say that a bright spot in all of this was that while I was done with my own field, there were many other things that I did find very interesting as I encountered them. I was spending time in Singapore and loved learning as much as I could about martime Southeast Asia. When I wasn't in Singapore I was at MIT where I got a lot of peripheral exposure to new ways in which people were understanding the world through data, and found that shift in knowledge-making both fascinating and exciting. I say this was a bright spot because I realized that there were LOTS of things I could find interesting in the world, and given that, I reasoned that there must be *something* else out there that I could do. I also admitted to myself that writing history was something that I had undertaken almost as challenge. Whereas some of my peers were clearly just...born to write art history, I knew that my natural talents lay in something more analytic, likely more quantitative, and certainly less interprative. And I was like, enough of this, let's do something that is more of a natural fit for me.",

            "Obviously having financial and general life stability is a wonderful thing that alleviated much of the misery I was feeling as a Ph.D student. I have been able to maintain my friendships with people from my Ph.D program, and frankly, I'm probably a better friend now that I'm significantly happier. I have no idea if there are people from that time in my life who mostly think of me as someone who 'failed' at academia, because I honestly do not care. It's their loss if they think I'm a failure.",
            "A less obvious question may be weather I miss my field, or wish I could still engage with it somehow. And the answer is no. My instinct that I was done with my field when I had my moment of crisis was indeed correct. The nice thing about this is that having completely moved on from my former field has made space for me to become interested in and knowledgable about so many new things. I feel as intellectually stimulated today as I did a a Ph.D student. I do attribute a lot of this to having actually done the Ph.D and learned how to learn truly on one's own.",

I am very very glad I finished my Ph.D. I hate that this is the case, but having the degree on my resume has opened doors and beeen used to justify a higher salary. I also am proud to have worked through it and finished and I learned a lot about myself through the process.",
            'As for whether I wish I had not done it, that is hard, but mostly I think I do not. My reasons for possibly saying yes are that I missed out on a good chunk of time to build earning power and savings, and that if I had found what I do now, I would be so much more experienced at it which would be great. However, I really truly got a lot out of my Ph.D, and I highly doubt I would be as good at my job as I am now without it, even though on paper there is no skill transfer. I just am a significantly better thinker. Doing my Ph.D also radically expanded my world view in so many ways, and I am extremely grateful for that.',
            'It is probably good to note that my program came with five years of funding, and I did everything I could to not come of out the program with less money than I had going into it, including teaching at other schools. If I had taken on debt I would likely feel very differently.',

Ask people about what roles in their organization they could imagine someone like you in, ask them if they can imagine ",
