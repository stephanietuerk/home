            "Once upon a time I did a Ph.D in the history of architecture. I was warned not to do this unless I had nothing else I wanted to pursue aside from a career as an architectural historian, and indeed went into the program with every intention of having a career in academia as an architectural historian. My program (which I admire and benefited from greatly) trains you to do only this, and there really aren't 'industry' jobs our there for architectural historians.",
            "But, I left the both the field and academia anyway at the end of a postdoc. I learned a tremendous amount during that process and want to share it with others. I've had a number of conversations with current academics (mostly Ph.D students or recent grads) about leaving and wanted to jot down some of the things I find myself saying many times, with the hope that it will be useful to others.",

            "This is intended for anyone in academia who has ever had a thought about leaving, whether from frustration, out of necessity, or whatever other reason. My experience is that almost everyone has had this thought, but that there remains a lot of discomfort around it and as a result, it is a thought that people often have alone. I hope that my experiences can provide context for people's own thoughts on this subject as well as to normalize them.",
            'Because I have a humanities degree with no clear industry afterlife, and from a field and program in which very very few people have left academia / the field before, my thoughts are probably most useful for people coming from similar situations.',

            "I first started imagining alternate careers when I was abroad doing dissertation research, completely unstimulated by and lost with my research. Mostly these were fantasies that likely wouldn't have been something I wanted to pursue long-term -- becoming a trainer at the gym was one of them I remember.",
            "Those fantasies remained in the back of my mind, but several years later, very stuck and very frustrated in the writing phase of my dissertation (and now abroad on a different continent), I had a pretty important revelation. First, I admitted to myself how miserable I was. I hadn't really done this because all of my mental energy was focused on my dissertation progress, and I hadn't even been able to step back to make this assessment. I also at this time looked forward, and tried to imagine the best outcome possible for me in the field. Actually, I tried to imagine one that was far better than what was actually possible, and I saw myself ten years later, still miserable and feeling like a fraud, even as a tenured professor at say, Columbia.",
            "I realized -- or rather, finally admitted to myself -- that I just had no investment in my field anymore. The most engaging courses I took as a PhD student were all outside of my field, and I couldn't figure out how to translate them into scholarship in my field. I didn't want to buy books in my field anymore and I felt like I had nothing truly meaningful to say within it.",
            "Additionally, since this was the mid to late 2010s, the job market was just getting worse and worse. I knew that my chances of getting a job were not great -- especially since I had nothing to say! (ha) -- and I knew that if I was already miserable as a Ph.D student / postdoc, things would only get worse -- and probably way worse -- if I was barely scraping by financially and moving every semester for VAP jobs. That life is challenging for anyone, but if you actually aren't even excited by your field and doing work within it (with the exception of teaching which I have always loved but we all know that your career is made on scholarship) -- I just found myself saying, why would I subject myself to that? I could not think of a single reason.",
            "I will say that a bright spot in all of this was that while I was done with my own field, there were many other things that I did find very interesting as I encountered them. I was spending time in Singapore and loved learning as much as I could about martime Southeast Asia. When I wasn't in Singapore I was at MIT where I got a lot of peripheral exposure to new ways in which people were understanding the world through data, and found that shift in knowledge-making both fascinating and exciting. I say this was a bright spot because I realized that there were LOTS of things I could find interesting in the world, and given that, I reasoned that there must be *something* else out there that I could do. I also admitted to myself that writing history was something that I had undertaken almost as challenge. Whereas some of my peers were clearly just...born to write art history, I knew that my natural talents lay in something more analytic, likely more quantitative, and certainly less interprative. And I was like, enough of this, let's do something that is more of a natural fit for me.",

            "There are some things I would never tell people to do -- for example, 'you absolutely should (or shouldn't) leave academia' -- but there is one thing that I tell everyone to do without hesitation and with a lot of conviction: TALK TO ANYONE YOU CAN TALK TO.",
            "Ask everyone you know if they know anyone who was in a remotely similar place to where you are now who has left academia and ask if they could put you in touch. Do not turn any offered connection / conversation down -- maybe you are like, I'm a comp lit person and my friend offered to put me in touch with their friend who left academia with a CS Ph.D and now is at Google -- that's not going to be applicable! Wrong, talk to that person. If someone offers a conversation with someone in an industry you are competely opposed to working in, take them up on their offer.",
            "Why do I think this is so important? My experience is that it is extremely difficult to understand the landscape of jobs and organizations outside of academia from within it. And if you don't know that things exist, you can't want to do them, apply to them, etc.. Ask people about what roles in their organization they could imagine someone like you in, ask them if they can imagine ",
