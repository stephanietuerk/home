    >The Medicaid and CHIP Scorecard and the Core Set Data Dashboard are
    public-facing data platforms that the federal Medicaid program supports to
    share state- and national-level data about health care utilization and
    outcomes, expenditures, and program administration with state Medicaid
    programs, researchers, and the public.</p

  <p class="left-col text takeaway"
    >I led the complete redesign and redevelopment of the the Scorecard product
    beginning in February 2023, overcoming significant tech stack
    <span #techStack></span> and timeline limitations to deliver in December
    2023. In light of the Scorecard's success, the Centers for Medicare &
    Medicaid Services requested that we build a second product that could use
    the same infrastructure to make a different set of data available in a site
    with its own identity. That product, the Core Set Data Dashboard, uses the
    same frontend code base with environment-based configuration and was
    released in January 2025, after 3.5 months of development.</p

  <p class="left-col text"
    >The Scorecard site was first released in 2018 and featured rudimentary data
    displays of a curated set of measures within the Medicaid.gov content
    management system. A number of organizations, including the National
    Association for Medicaid Directors,

      href="https://syrtissolutions.com/cms-releases-medicaid-scorecard/"

    >
    of the data, and Medicaid itself had a strong desire to expand the Scorecard
    into a more robust and interactive product.</p

  <p class="left-col text"
    >A new, three-year development contract was awarded in 2021 to rebuild the
    site with these concerns in mind. In winter 2022-2023, with development
    progress stalled on that contract, Mathematica (my employer, which also has
    the contract for aggregating the data that drives Scorecard) took on the
    development contract for the revised site, with the intention of delivering
    by the end of the original three-year development contract, i.e. in less
    than a year.</p

  <p class="left-col text"
    >Initially, I was brought on to lead frontend development of the site in
    February 2023. In this capacity, I very early on identified significant
    limitations of the design at that time—there was planned functionality that
    could not be supported by the data, circuitous user flows, and multiple
    semantic framings of the same information. Based on these findings, a
    decision was made that a new design that correctly surfaced the data and
    provided a coherent plan for development was the only way to deliver a
    product by end of year.</p
  >
  <p class="left-col text"
    >From March through June of 2023, I led the redesign effort for the site
    along with two wonderful designers on my team at Mathematica, working
    closely with project leaders at Medicaid to discover and understand
    requirements and validate our team's design proposals and solutions.</p

  <p class="section-title">Technical Approach</p>
  <p class="left-col text"
    >Development began almost immediately alongside design work, with
    requirements evolving throughout the summer as the full complexity of the
    data was surfaced.
  </p>
  <p class="left-col text"
    >As design lead, I (along with the design team members) advocated for a
    unified interface for selecting and displaying data that would support a
    consistent mental model across measures. In parallel, I prioritized creating
    a single frontend data model that mirrored the coherence of the interface
    and could systematically handle a wide range of data structures, rather than
    incorporating measure-specific logic into the frontend code. (After three
    years of feature development, we still maintain this approach.)
  </p>
  <p class="left-col text"
    >This served two purposes. First, it was essential for user
    comprehension—without systematic behavior, users would struggle to interpret
    and compare data across the different measures in the platform. Introducing
    measure-specific logic would likely have made the interface inconsistent.
    Second, it enabled us to begin development immediately and have
    significantly fewer issues as new requirements, such as new measure types,
    additional properties, and additional levels of data hierarchy continued to
    be identified through August of our first development year. This approach
    also made expansion in development cycles straightforward. A notable outcome
    of this was our team's ability to develop and deploy a second product, using
    a different dataset but the same frontend codebase, in under four
    months—including external security and Section 508 reviews and stakeholder
    QA.</p
  >
  <p class="left-col text"
    >To manage frontend state, I implemented a custom RxJS reactive state
    management service that synchronizes application state with URL parameters,
    providing both a source of truth for the frontend codebase that propagated
    changes throughout the site and the critical functionality (in a
    public-policy context in particular) of allowing users to save and share
    views of specific data through the URL.</p

</section>
<section class="section">
  <p class="section-title">Technical Challenges</p>
  <p class="left-col text"
    >The technical complexity of the project came from two sources: strict
    platform constraints, and the inconsistent structure of the underlying data.
    On top of this, because the data is public and politically sensitive, it
    needed to be presented precisely and with its full context, without
    suppressing nuance.</p
  >
  <p class="left-col text"
    >A non-negotible requirement of the project was that data needed to be
    hosted on data.medicaid.gov as flat CSV files. Without access to a queryable
    API, the frontend took on significant additional data manipulation and
    derivation responsibilities. This included parsing, reshaping, and
    filtering, though the most challenging was deriving cascading selection
    options and validating existing downstream user selections when an upstream
    selection changed.
  </p>
  <p class="left-col text"
    >Not only did the measures in our data have many different schemas, but
    within measures, data was reported differently across eligibilty
    populations, time periods, states, and data types (e.g. count / percent).
    This variability in the data would have created a high likelihood that users
    would encounter a "no data available for these selections" situation when
    using the interface. Project leaders at Medicaid and our design team were
    aligned on wanting to avoid these situations.
  </p>
  <p class="left-col text"
    >This requires the frontend to compute updated selection options that yield
    valid data when the user makes a change. It also validates the user’s
    existing selections and, when needed, automatically generates a new valid
    selection that best approximates the previous one.</p
