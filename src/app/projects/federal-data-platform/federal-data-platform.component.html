    >The Medicaid and CHIP Scorecard and the Core Set Data Dashboard are
    public-facing data platforms that the federal Medicaid program supports to
    share state- and national-level data about health care utilization and
    outcomes, expenditures, and program administration with state Medicaid
    programs, researchers, and the public.</p

  <p class="main text"
    >I led the complete redesign and redevelopment of the the Scorecard product
    beginning in February 2023, overcoming significant tech stack
    <span #techStack></span> and timeline limitations to deliver in December
    2023. In light of the Scorecard's success, the Centers for Medicare &
    Medicaid Services requested that we build a second product that could use
    the same infrastructure to make a different set of data available in a site
    with its own identity. That product, the Core Set Data Dashboard, uses the
    same frontend code base with environment-based configuration and was
    released in January 2025, after 3.5 months of development.</p

    >A new, three-year development contract was awarded in 2021 to rebuild the
    site with these concerns in mind. In winter 2022-2023, with development
    progress stalled on that contract, Mathematica (my employer, which also has
    the contract for aggregating the data that drives Scorecard) took on the
    development contract for the revised site, with the intention of delivering
    by the end of the original three-year development contract, i.e. in less
    than a year.</p
  >
  <p class="main text"
    >Initially, I was brought on to lead frontend development of the site in
    February 2023. In this capacity, I very early on identified significant
    limitations of the design at that time—there was planned functionality that
    could not be supported by the data, circuitous user flows, and multiple
    semantic framings of the same information. Based on these findings, a
    decision was made that a new design that correctly surfaced the data and
    provided a coherent plan for development was the only way to deliver a
    product by end of year.</p
  >
  <p class="main text"
    >From March through June of 2023, I led the redesign effort for the site
    along with two wonderful designers on my team at Mathematica, working
    closely with project leaders at Medicaid to discover and understand
    requirements and validate our team's design proposals and solutions. Our
    design approach was driven by three objectives: maximizing usability and
    comprehension for diverse user types, ensuring that the site's
    politically-sensitive data maintained full context and precision, and
    building an extensible foundation that could evolve with new measures and
    user needs.</p
  >
  <p class="main text"
    >The redesign introduced a unified, searchable and filterable measure cards
    interface that presents all 60+ healthcare measures in a scannable format,
    allowing users browse measures and view their characteristic properties
    before selecting one to explore in depth. On click, each measure card leads
    to a consistent data exploration interface that intelligently adapts to what
    the measure's data can support. A set of core selection interfaces are
    always present, with available options determined by the measure's data
    structure and current selections: data tabs (national-level data,
    state-level data, measure information), time view toggle (point in time,
    across time), and display modes (map, bar, line, table), plus additional
    filtering options for demographics, value types, and other measure-specific
    dimensions relevant to the data.</p

<section class="section approach">
  <p class="main title">Technical Approach</p>
  <p class="main text"
    >Development began almost immediately alongside design work, with
    requirements evolving throughout the summer as the full complexity of the
    data was surfaced.
  </p>
  <p class="main text"
    >In parallel, I prioritized creating a single frontend data model that
    mirrored the coherence of the user interface and could systematically handle
    a wide range of data structures, rather than incorporating measure-specific
    logic into the frontend code. (After three years of feature development, we
    still maintain this approach.)
  </p>
  <p class="main text"
    >This served two purposes. First, it was essential for user
    comprehension—without systematic behavior, users would struggle to interpret
    and compare data across the different measures in the platform. Introducing
    measure-specific logic would likely have made the interface inconsistent.
    Second, it enabled us to begin development immediately and have
    significantly fewer issues as new requirements, such as new measure types,
    additional properties, and additional levels of data hierarchy continued to
    be identified through August of our first development year. This approach
    also made expansion in development cycles straightforward. A notable outcome
    of this was our team's ability to develop and deploy a second product, using
    a different dataset but the same frontend codebase, in under four
    months—including external security and Section 508 reviews and stakeholder
    QA.</p
  >
  <p class="main text"
    >To manage frontend state, I implemented a custom reactive state management
    service (using RxJS) that synchronizes application state with URL
    parameters. FIX ME This service provides both a source of truth for the
    frontend codebase that reactively updates data and views throughout the
    propagates changes throughout the site and the critical functionality (in a
    public-policy context in particular) of allowing users to save and share
    views of specific data through the URL.</p

<section class="section challenge">
  <p class="main title">Key Technical Challenge</p>
  <p class="main text"
    >The technical complexity of the project came from two sources: strict
    platform constraints, and the inconsistent structure of the underlying data.
  </p>
  <p class="main text"
    >A non-negotible requirement of the project was that data needed to be
    hosted on data.medicaid.gov as flat CSV files. Without access to a queryable
    API, the frontend took on significant data manipulation and derivation
    responsibilities. This included parsing, reshaping, and filtering, though
    the most challenging was deriving cascading selection options and validating
    existing user selections in real time when a user changed a selection.

  <p class="main text"
    >Our data varied not only across measures, but also within them, with data
    reported differently across eligibilty populations, time periods, states,
    and data types (e.g. count / percent). This variability in the data would
    have created a high likelihood that users would encounter a "no data
    available for these selections" situation when using the interface. Project
    leaders at Medicaid and our design team were aligned on wanting to avoid
    these situations.
  </p>
  <p class="main text"
    >This requires the frontend to compute updated selection options that yield
    valid data when the user makes a change. The frontend also validates the
    user’s existing selections and, when needed, automatically generates a new
    valid selection that best approximates the previous one. This was enabled by
    the app’s fully reactive architecture, which allowed selection logic, state
    synchronization, and view updates to remain consistent and maintainable
    across the platform.</p
