  I gathered data using the wikia python library that provides an interface on
  top of the Wikia API. Many thanks to Ryan Heuser whose Colab notebook for
  English Lit jobs data scraping I used as a model for getting data from the
  Wikia page. I aggregated data using a few python and TypeScript scripts. You
  can find a description of the workflows

<p class="description">
  For each job posting, I attributed one or more fields, such as Modern /
  Contemporary Art, a tenure status (tenure track, non-tenure track, and
  unknown), and one or more ranks, such as assistant professor or postdoc. The
  vast majority of this (~95%) was done programmatically, using the field
  headings that jobs are posted on the wiki page and scanning text for keywords
  related to tenure status and rank. However, I also manually verify these
  values for every job posting. (The most tedious part of this whole project.)
</p>
<p class="description">
  I regularized field names across the years (so that Contemporary / Modern Art
  and Modern / Contemporary Art became the same category) and also imputed
  fields manually in some instances. In 2011-2012, Contemporary Art, Modern Art,
  Architecture and Design was a single category, and I sorted those jobs by hand
  into the appropriate categories that were used in all other years, based on
  the job descriptions. In 2020, a Visiting Positions / Limited-Term
  Appointments / Postdocs category appeared on the site, and I likewise sorted
  these into fields based on job description, and accounted for the temporary
  nature of these jobs in the rank category. For the data shown in this
  interface, I filtered out all jobs whose rank was solely "postdoc", as I
  wanted to focus on postings for faculty positions.

<p class="description">
  I also checked the data to make sure there weren't nonsensical combinations,
  such as a tenure-track postdoc, and manually verified and corrected the data
  in a number of places.

<p class="description">
  If you think there is an error in the data, please do not hesitate to get in
  touch. Additionally, if you think that a job listing is missing, the best way
  to have it added is to add the listing yourself to the Academic Jobs Wiki, and
  then let me know so that I can re-run the data scraping and processing
  scripts.

<h3 class="section-subheader">Field Imputation</h3>
<p class="description">
  Across all years for which jobs are listed in the Academic Wiki, there are
  over 60 different field names listed for jobs. Given that the highest number
  of jobs for any one year was not even three times this number of fields, I
  decided to consolidate categories to create more coherence in the data. In
  part for this same reason, I leaned towards letting fields have historical
  continuity in their names. A side of effect of this is change within fields is
  not immediately visible in this dataâ€”for example, jobs for North American Art
  in 2023 are almost entirely focused on indigenous art, whereas those from 2011
  may focus on turn of the 20th century painting. Needless to say, other
  completely defensible decisions around field creation could have been made
  that would make the data look different.

  >A few other difficult decisions I made included whether positions for
  Pre-Columbian Art should fall under Ancient Art or Latin American Art, how a
  job focusing on "British Art" with no time period attached should be
  categorized, how many distinct regions of the world listed in a single post
  gets the job classified as simply "global," and at what point in time does
  "applicants should have a global focus" simply become "general / open"?
</p>
<p class="description">
  Generally speaking, I urge you to think critically about how groupings, small
  numbers, the fact that not all jobs in the field are posted to the Wiki,
  incomplete descriptions, and other factors lead to this data being a good, but
  imperfect, representation of the art history job market.
