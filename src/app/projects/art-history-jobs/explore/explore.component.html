    >The charts below answer questions about the number of jobs or the share of
    jobs, and how those values changed over time. The charts are initialized to
    look at the percentage of jobs, among all tenure-track jobs, for the fields
    with the highest share of jobs in {{ yearsRange[1] }}. The chart on the
    right shows the extent to which this year's value is higher or lower than
    the average value for that field across all years.</p

  <p class="description">
    You can change the charts by using use the interfaces in the data selections
    bar to select fields, tenure statuses, and job ranks according to your
    interests. You can also use those interfaces to switch between count and
    percentage data, and to modify the years shown in the charts. Above the
    right-hand change over time chart, you can select whether you want to
    compare the current year's values to their respective averages across all
    years, or to the values from the first year in the selected time range.
