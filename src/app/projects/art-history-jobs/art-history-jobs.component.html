      serves as an informal clearinghouse for academic job postings. Inspired by
      similar efforts for Literature and History, this project provides an
      interface for visually exploring aggregated job postings from the Academic
      Jobs Wiki to facilitate a data-driven understanding of the Art History job
      market.

    <p class="description">
      Throughout the humanities, there is a collective understanding that
      academic job markets are "in crisis," but as far as I know, there are no
      attempts to describe this quantitatively. The data presented are an
      attempt tp facilitate a shared understanding of hiring trends within the
      field. I hope that this is useful for prospective and current PhD students
      and faculty alike.

      >This interface allows users to explore {{ dataYears[1] - dataYears[0] +
      1}} years of data, from {{ dataYears[0] }} to {{ dataYears[1] }},
      aggregated by scraping jobs posted on the Academic Jobs Wiki. Users can
      view changes in the total number of jobs over time as well as explore jobs
      by field, tenure status, job rank, and institution.</p

      >Along with a
      <span (click)="scrollTo('summary')" class="section-link"
        >summary chart</span
      >
      of jobs by field across time, there are two interactive sections in this
      project that you can use to explore the data according to your
      interest.</p
    >
    <p class="description"
      >The
      <span (click)="scrollTo('jobCharacteristics')" class="section-link"
        >Explore by Job Characteristics</span
      >
      section can be used to ask questions about the quantity of jobs. This
      includes questions such as, "has the number of tenure-track jobs in Global
      / Non-Western Art increased or decreased over time?" and "how does the
      share of jobs listed for specific regions compare to that of jobs listed
      as General / Open?"
    </p>
    <p class="description"
      >The
      <span (click)="scrollTo('schools')" class="section-link"
        >Explore by Institution</span
      >
      section can be used to ask questions that begin with, "which schools...?"
      For example, you could use this section to understand which schools have
      historically hired for a specific field, which schools hire frequently, or
      which schools only hire for non-tenure track positions.
