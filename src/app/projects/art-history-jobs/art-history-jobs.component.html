      In the field of Art History, the Academic Jobs wiki serves as an informal
      clearinghouse for academic job postings. Inspired by similar efforts for
      Literature and History, this project provides an interface for visually
      exploring aggregated job postings from the Academic Jobs Wiki to
      facilitate a data-driven understanding of the Art History job market.

      Throughout the humanities, there is a collective understanding that
      academic job markets are "in crisis," but as far as I know, there are no
      attempts to describe this quantitatively. The data presented are an
      attempt tp facilitate a shared understanding of hiring trends within the
      field. I hope that this is useful for prospective and current PhD students
      and faculty alike.

      >This interface allows users to explore {{ mainDataService.dataYears[1] -
      mainDataService.dataYears[0] + 1}} years of data, from {{
      mainDataService.dataYears[0] }} to {{ mainDataService.dataYears[1] }}
      aggregated by scarping jobs posted on the Academic Jobs Wiki. Users can
      view changes in the <span>total number of jobs</span> over time as well as
      explore jobs by <span>subfield</span>, <span>tenure status</span>,
      <span>job rank</span>, and <span>institution.</span></p
